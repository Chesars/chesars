## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]!

🎯 I'm a Full Stack Developer with a background in Marketing, currently focused on backend development using NestJS and scalable API design.

🚀 I’ve built over 50 WordPress websites for small and medium-sized businesses (both local and international), and I'm completing an advanced Full Stack bootcamp at **Soy Henry**, backed by Y Combinator.

 I’ve also studied how to use AI and LLMs for building smart solutions, integrating APIs and real-world tools to solve modern business problems.
